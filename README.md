# Animated Navigation Project

*Udemy Javascript Web Project #7*  

In this project I learned about using CSS to animate a custom navigation bar

*Fundamentals covered:*

-  CSS variables to set color families  
-  CSS transform/transition commands  
-  Using CSS ::before operator to add stylized lines to items in flex column  
-  nth-of-type CSS directive to modify backgrounds of multiple list items  
-  Used CSS animations with keyframes  
-  Code cleanup to reduce multiple CSS class replace calls as well as reduce event listener lines
